Project Name: Event Calendar Web Application

Description:
-------------
The Event Calendar is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap. 
It allows users to efficiently manage and organize their events by providing an interactive calendar interface. 
Users can add, edit, and delete events on specific dates, view schedules in daily, weekly, or monthly formats, 
and navigate the calendar easily. The application is fully responsive and works across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

2. Daily, weekly, and monthly calendar views.
3. Responsive design using Bootstrap.
4. Dynamic interactions powered by jQuery.
5. Event highlighting for easy identification.
6. Customizable event details (name, date, time, description).
7. Scalable architecture for future enhancements like notifications and multi-user support.

Tools & Technologies:
